    <div class="About">
    <p>Welcome ! I am a published childrens book author and illustrator, just graduated in July 2023 for a Masters Degree in 
        Indie Game Development, and currently studying for a career as a Full Stack Developer with Codecademy.</p>

            <p>Throughout the masters, I explored most areas of game development, and learn't many different applications, 
                Adobe Animate, Character Animator, and Premiere-Pro. I also worked with 3dsMax, Maya and Blender's animation 3D 
                modeling software.</p>
                <p>
                However after, I was eager to learn about creating interactive elements, for applications, and web development.
                I started studying to be a full stack engineer, with Codecademy in May 2023, just before graduation, and 
                have been consistantly practicing with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and GitHub.</p>

                <p>I am extremely motivated and enthusiastic about my career path ahead of me, and can't wait to immerse myself,
                    in the world of web development. 
                </p>
